1. Objective:

Our project aimed to detect phishing websites and alert users, providing an additional layer of security to minimize risks like data breaches and financial loss.

2. Technologies Used:

Python for scripting and data analysis.

AI algorithms (e.g., supervised learning models like decision trees, or neural networks) for classification of phishing versus legitimate websites.



3. Methodology:

Data Collection: Gathered a dataset of phishing and legitimate websites (e.g., features like URL structure, SSL certificate usage, and content analysis).

Model Development: Trained an AI model on these features to predict whether a site is phishing or not.

Deployment: Integrated the model into an AI-powered browser extension for real-time detection.



4. Challenges & Solutions:

Challenge: Handling false positives/negatives in predictions.
Solution: Tuned the model using feature engineering and cross-validation techniques.

Challenge: Scalability to detect phishing across diverse digital channels.
Solution: Optimized the model for real-time performance without excessive resource usage.



5. Impact:

"This project enhances user awareness and cybersecurity, proactively preventing phishing attacks across digital platforms."
